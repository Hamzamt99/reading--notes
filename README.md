## Groth Mindset

## *Intro*:smiley:

Hello my Nmae is Hamza and im 22 years old i study a software engineer at Ltuc and its my last semester in the college


### **Summary**

A growth mindset holds that oneâ€™s core skills may be developed via hard work and dedication; intelligence and talent are just beginning points. A passion of learning is linked with a development mentality. In a fixed mentality, on the other hand, intellect and skill are regarded as fixed attributes, implying that success is based only on these natural abilities, with no need for additional growth or effort.

How to remindes my self to keep in a groth mindset :

- *Not to lose faith*
- *Work hard and persistently*
- *Learn from my mistakes and the mistakes of others*
