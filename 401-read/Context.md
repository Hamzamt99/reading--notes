# Scaling Up with Reducer and Context
## How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)'
*useReducer is a hook that allows you to manage complex state logic by providing a predictable and structured way to handle state changes. It's similar to how you might manage state in a Redux store. You define a reducer function that specifies how the state should change based on dispatched actions, and then you can dispatch actions from any component to update the state.
By centralizing state logic in a reducer function, you promote predictability and maintainability in your codebase.
useContext, on the other hand, provides a way to share data and functions across components without the need for prop drilling (passing props through multiple levels of components).
When you combine useReducer with useContext, you can create a centralized state management system where the state is stored in a context, and the reducer function dispatches actions to modify that state.
Components can then access the state and dispatch actions from anywhere in the component tree without having to pass down props explicitly. This significantly simplifies state management in larger applications,
as you no longer need to manually pass props through intermediate components that don't directly use the data.*
