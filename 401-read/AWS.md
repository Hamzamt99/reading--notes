# AWS: Cloud Servers:
## AWS EC2:
### Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

### 1- What is an EC2 Instance?
An EC2 Instance is a virtual server in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, allowing users to run applications and services. 
It offers a wide selection of computing resources, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capabilities. Users can choose from various instance types to suit their specific requirements and pay for the hours or seconds they use.

### 2- Name 2 use cases for EC2:
- Web Hosting: EC2 instances can be used to host websites, web applications, and content, providing scalable and reliable infrastructure to handle varying levels of traffic.
- Big Data Processing: EC2 instances can be employed to process large-scale data analytics, data warehousing, and machine learning tasks, leveraging the cloud's computing power and storage capabilitie.

 ## 3- Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com:
 One reason to use Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) over services like Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com is the seamless integration with the broader AWS ecosystem, enabling easier management and scalability of containerized applications while leveraging a wide range of AWS services.

 ## EC2 For Humans:
 You can find EC2 on the AWS Management Console under the "Compute" section. It is typically located in the left-hand navigation menu under "EC2" or "Elastic Compute Cloud."

 ### Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL:
 You can find EC2 on the AWS Management Console under the "Compute" section. It is typically located in the left-hand navigation menu under "EC2" or "Elastic Compute Cloud."

 ### Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend:
 A "compute cycle" is like a small unit of work your computer performs to complete a task, such as running a program or loading a webpage.
 The more compute cycles a computer can handle, the faster it can do things.

 ## Elastic Beanstalk:
 ### What is Elastic Beanstalk?
Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service provided by AWS that simplifies the deployment and management of web applications and services.
It automatically handles infrastructure provisioning, scaling, load balancing, and monitoring, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

### Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk:
EC2 is a core component of Elastic Beanstalk.
Elastic Beanstalk uses EC2 instances to deploy and run applications, providing an easy-to-use layer of abstraction on top of EC2 for streamlined application deployment and management.

## Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk:
- Easy Application Deployment: Elastic Beanstalk automates the deployment process, making it simple to deploy web applications and services without worrying about infrastructure setup.

- Scalability: It automatically scales the underlying infrastructure based on demand, ensuring your application can handle varying levels of traffic without manual intervention.

- Monitoring and Management: Elastic Beanstalk provides built-in monitoring and management features, allowing you to track application performance and health easily. It also integrates with other AWS services for enhanced functionality.
