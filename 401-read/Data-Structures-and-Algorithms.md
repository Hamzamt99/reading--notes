## Basic Data Structures : 
 
 *Basic data structures are fundamental building blocks used to organize and store data in computer programs. They provide efficient ways to access, insert, delete, and manipulate data. Here are some commonly used basic data structures:*

*Arrays: An array is a collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Elements in an array can be accessed using their index, which starts at 0. Arrays offer constant-time access to elements, but inserting or deleting elements may require shifting other elements.*

*Linked Lists: A linked list is a collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the list. Linked lists allow efficient insertion and deletion at any position but have slower access time compared to arrays.*

*Stacks: A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure. Elements are added or removed from only one end, called the top of the stack. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Stacks are commonly used for function call management, expression evaluation, and backtracking.*

*Queues: A queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure. Elements are added at one end, called the rear, and removed from the other end, called the front. Queues are useful for managing tasks in a sequential order, such as scheduling jobs or handling requests.*

*Trees: A tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes. Each node contains data and references to its child nodes. Trees have a root node at the top, and every other node is connected by edges. Common variations include binary trees, AVL trees, and binary search trees.*

*Graphs: A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs can be either directed (edges have a specific direction) or undirected. Graphs are useful for modeling relationships between objects, such as social networks, road networks, or dependency graphs.*

*Hash Tables: A hash table (or hash map) is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values. It provides fast retrieval and insertion of key-value pairs. Hash tables are commonly used for implementing dictionaries, caches, and symbol tables.*

## Why Big O : 

### Big O notation is used to analyze and describe the efficiency or complexity of algorithms and data structures. It provides a standardized way to express the worst-case time complexity or space complexity of an algorithm as a function of the input size.

*There are several reasons why Big O notation is important:*

*Efficiency Comparison: Big O notation allows us to compare and evaluate the efficiency of different algorithms or data structures. By analyzing their time or space complexity, we can determine which one will perform better for a given problem size.*

*Scalability Prediction: Big O notation helps us understand how the performance of an algorithm or data structure will scale as the input size grows. It provides insights into whether an algorithm will be able to handle larger data sets or if it will become impractical due to its high complexity.*

*Algorithm Design: Big O notation plays a crucial role in designing efficient algorithms. By considering the time and space complexity, we can optimize our algorithm design choices to reduce resource usage and improve performance.*

*Overall, Big O notation is a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing the efficiency of algorithms and data structures. It helps us make informed decisions when designing, comparing, and optimizing code to achieve better performance.*

# Discussion Questions : 

### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem? 
*One of the most important things to consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem is the efficiency of the operations required by the problem.*

### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

*To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, you can take the following measures:*

*Base Case: Every recursive function should have a base case, which is a condition that terminates the recursion. The base case represents the simplest form of the problem that does not require further recursion. It ensures that the recursion stops at some point and prevents infinite recursion.*

*Progress Towards Base Case: In addition to the base case, the recursive function should make progress towards the base case in each recursive call. This means that the parameters or inputs passed to the recursive function should change in a way that brings it closer to the base case. This ensures that the recursive calls eventually reach the base case and terminate.*
