# Event Driven Applications:
## What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
### -The native Node.js module that enables Event Driven Programming is the events module. It provides the EventEmitter class,
### allowing you to create custom events and register event listeners. By utilizing this module, you can build applications that respond to and handle asynchronous events efficiently.

## What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) complements Event Driven Programming (EDP) by providing code organization, reusability, and modularity in event-driven systems.

## onsider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
### Event Driven Programming in Node.js on the backend enables efficient handling of multiple requests, enhances performance, and ensures responsiveness by leveraging non-blocking I/O operations and the ability to handle a large number of concurrent connections.
