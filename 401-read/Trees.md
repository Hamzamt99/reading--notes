# Trees:
## WHY trees ? 
### Using trees in JavaScript can be beneficial for various reasons. Here are a few reasons why you might want to use trees and some documentation resources to explore further:
### Organizing hierarchical data: Trees are well-suited for representing hierarchical data structures.
### They allow you to organize data in a hierarchical manner, making it easier to manage relationships between different elements. 
### Efficient searching and sorting: Trees can be used to efficiently search and sort data. Various tree algorithms, such as binary search trees or AVL trees, offer efficient search and insertion operations.
### They can help you find and manipulate data quickly, which can be useful in scenarios like maintaining a sorted collection of items or implementing efficient search algorithms.

## WHAT is the trees ? 
### JavaScript itself does not have specific built-in documentation for trees since trees are a general data structure concept that can be implemented in any programming language, including JavaScript. However, there are resources and documentation available that explain how to work with trees in JavaScript. Here are a few recommended resources:

### - MDN Web Docs: The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides comprehensive documentation on JavaScript. 
### "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke: This book is a popular resource for learning JavaScript. It covers various topics, including data structures and algorithms, and provides explanations and examples

## How to use trees ? 
### 1- Understand the Tree Data Structure:
#### Familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of trees, including nodes, parent-child relationships, root, and leaf nodes. Understand different types of trees, such as binary trees, n-ary trees, and balanced trees like AVL or Red-Black trees.

### 2- Choose an Implementation Approach:
#### Decide how you want to implement trees in JavaScript. You can use objects, classes, or arrays to represent nodes and their relationships. Determine the necessary properties and methods for the tree structure.
