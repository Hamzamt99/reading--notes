# What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?
*is a security model that manages user permissions based on their assigned roles.
It restricts access to resources and actions by defining roles with specific privileges, simplifying access management and enhancing security.
Users are assigned roles, and their access is determined by those roles, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and ensuring a structured access control system.
RBAC is commonly used in computer systems and networks to maintain data integrity and confidentiality.*

# Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.
### Role: Guest
### Role: user
### Role: Admin

# What are the Benefits of RBAC?
### -Enhanced Security: RBAC helps enforce the principle of least privilege, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and security breaches.

### -Simplified Access Management: RBAC streamlines permission assignment, making it more efficient and less prone to errors.

### -Compliance Support: RBAC aids in achieving and demonstrating regulatory compliance by providing clear access control policies and auditability.

# Describe some react-cookie features?
- Simple Cookie Handling: React-Cookie simplifies cookie management in React by providing an easy-to-use API for setting, getting, and removing cookies. It abstracts the complexities of working with cookies in the browser, making it more convenient for developers.

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Support: React-Cookie is compatible with server-side rendering. It ensures that cookies are correctly handled on both the client and server sides of a React application, maintaining consistency and compatibility in SSR scenarios.

- Cookie Options: The library allows you to set various cookie options, such as expiration time, domain, path, and secure flags. This flexibility enables you to customize cookie behavior to suit your application's specific requirements, such as creating session cookies or persistent cookies.

# Which library would you prefer would you prefer? Why?
the choice between "react-cookie" and "react-cookies" depends on your project's specific needs. "react-cookie" offers a simple and widely-used API for managing cookies in React applications, making it a good choice for most scenarios. 
"react-cookies" is a component-based approach and might be preferred if you need more granular control over rendering cookies in your React components.
