# Linked List

## what is the linked list : 
### linked list is a common data structure used in computer science and programming.
### It is a linear collection of elements called nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. 
### The last node in the list typically points to null or has a null reference, indicating the end of the list.

## Here's an example of a simple linked list:
Node 1       Node 2       Node 3       Node 4
+------+    +------+    +------+    +------+
|  12  |    |  8   |    |  23  |    |  6   |
+------+    +------+    +------+    +------+
| next |--> | next |--> | next |--> | null |
+------+    +------+    +------+    +------+

## Why use linked lists?
### Linked lists are a fundamental data structure used in computer science and programming. They are particularly useful when you need dynamic data storage with efficient insertion and deletion operations. Some of the main reasons to use linked lists include:

### 1-Dynamic Size: Linked lists allow you to add or remove elements without requiring a fixed amount of memory upfront. This makes them suitable for scenarios where the size of the data structure may change over time.
### 2-Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Linked lists excel at insertion and deletion operations because they involve modifying only a few pointers, rather than shifting elements like in an array.
### 3-Flexible Memory Allocation: Linked lists can grow and shrink as needed, allocating memory for each element individually. This makes them suitable for environments with limited memory or when memory allocation is expensive.

## vocabulary/definition list:
###  example of a vocabulary/definition list:
### 1- Algorithm: A step-by-step procedure or set of rules designed to solve a specific problem or perform a specific task.

### 2- Array: A data structure that stores a collection of elements in a contiguous block of memory, where each element can be accessed by its index.

### 3- Binary Tree: A hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

### 4- Compiler: A program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into a lower-level language (e.g., machine code) that can be executed directly by a computer.

### 5- Database: An organized collection of structured data that can be stored, accessed, and managed efficiently.

## using an analogy:
### Imagine you have a train consisting of several cars, where each car is connected to the next one by a coupling. Each car contains some cargo. In this analogy:

### 1- The train represents the linked list.
### 2-Each car represents a node in the linked list.
### 3-The coupling between cars represents the reference or link from one node to the next.
