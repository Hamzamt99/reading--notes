# **Intro in Git**
## *Git*: 
 is a distributed version control system that is open source. To define Git, you'll need a lot of words.

Let me dissect it and explain the terminology:

Git is a content tracker, which means it has a control system. So Git may be used to store material, but because of the other advantages it offers, it is typically used to store code.

Git version control system: As new code is contributed, the code saved in Git changes. In addition, several developers can work on the same code at the same time. As a result, the Version Control System assists in dealing with this by keeping track of the modifications that have occurred. Git also has features like as branches and merges, which I'll go into later.

### *Why is it necessary to use a version control system like Git?*

Multiple developers are usually working on a project at the same time in real life. To guarantee that there are no code disputes amongst the developers, a version control system such as Git is required.

Furthermore, the needs for such initiatives are always changing. As a result, a version control system enables engineers to revert to a previous version of the code.

Finally, the same codebase is used by many projects that are running in parallel. The idea of branching in Git is critical in this situation.
