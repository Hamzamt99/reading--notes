# growth mindset
*Summary*

A **growth mindset** holds that one's core skills may be developed via hard work and dedication; intelligence and talent are just beginning points. A passion of learning is linked with a development mentality.
In a fixed mentality, on the other hand, intellect and skill are regarded as fixed attributes, implying that success is based only on these natural abilities, with no need for additional growth or effort.

Reminders to keep my slef in the **growth mindset**:

1-*Intelligence*

2-*effort*

3-*perseverance*

4-*learning*
