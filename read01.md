## *Summary*

**Markdown** is a web-based text formatting system. You have complete control over how the text appears; bolding or italicizing phrases, inserting photos, and making lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Markdown is mostly simply plain text with a few non-alphabetic characters like # or * tossed in for good measure.

Most locations on GitHub allow you to utilize Markdown:

- Gists

- Issues and Pull Requests with Comments

- Markdown (.md) and Markdown (.markdown) files
