# Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD :

## Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter?

*Middleware is a term commonly used in the context of web development, specifically in the backend or server-side applications. Think of middleware as a special kind of software component that sits between different parts of a web application and helps them work together smoothly.

*Imagine you have a big company with different departments. Each department has its own responsibilities and tasks. Now, let's say you want to pass information or requests between these departments in a structured and organized way. This is where middleware comes in.*

## Express the most popular __ __ ____?

*Express is the most popular web framework for building web applications.*

## Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

*When we say that Express is "unopinionated," it means that Express does not enforce strict rules or impose a specific way of structuring your application. It gives developers a lot of freedom and flexibility in how they design and organize their code.*

## What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

*module is a self-contained unit of code that performs a specific functionality or provides a set of related features.
Modules are designed to be independent and reusable, which promotes modularity in software architecture.*

####  It offers several benefits to developers:
- Code organization: Modules allow developers to organize their codebase into logical units, making it easier to navigate and understand
- Reusability: Modularity promotes code reusability. Once a module is built and tested, it can be reused in multiple projects or different parts of the same project
- Testing and Debugging: By breaking down a system into smaller modules, testing and debugging become more focused and easier to perform.

## What is NPM?
*is a software package manager for Node.js.*
*It is a command-line tool that comes bundled with Node.js and provides a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and packages that developers can use to enhance their projects*

#### What version of npm are you running on your machine?
##### 9.7.1.

#### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

##### npm install jshint.

## What is TDD?

#### Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

*Imagine you are planning a trip by car. Before embarking on your journey, it's important to check if the car is in good condition and ready for the road. 
*Similarly, in software development, tests act as checkpoints to ensure that the code is working correctly and ready for use.*

#### What are three expected benefits of testing
- Bug Detection and Prevention: Testing helps identify bugs and issues early in the development cycle.
- Software Stability and Reliability: Through comprehensive testing, developers can ensure that the software behaves as intended and meets the specified requirements
- Maintainability and Scalability: Well-designed tests provide a safety net when making changes or adding new features to the software.

#### Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests?
- Incomplete Test Coverage:
 One common individual pitfall is writing tests that don't provide sufficient coverage for the codebase
- Overly Complex or Fragile Tests:
 Another pitfall is writing tests that are overly complex or fragile
- Lack of Test Strategy or Guidelines:
 One common team pitfall is not having a clear test strategy or guidelines in place
 
 ### CI/CD 
#### What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
- Early Detection of Integration Issues
- Improved Software Quality
- Faster Feedback Loop

#### What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
- *Continuous Delivery*: 
Continuous Delivery is a software development practice that focuses on ensuring that code changes can be delivered to production reliably and with minimal manual intervention.
It involves automating various stages of the software delivery process, including building, testing, and deploying applications.
- *Continuous Deployment*:
 Continuous Deployment takes the concept of Continuous Delivery a step further.
 With Continuous Deployment, every code change that passes the automated tests and checks is automatically deployed to the production environment without any manual intervention or approval.
 
 #### Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background?
 *GitHub acts as a shared workspace where developers can store and manage their code. It provides a repository, which is like a virtual storage space for all the code files and related resources of a project. 
 Developers can create branches within the repository to work on specific features or fixes independently.*
