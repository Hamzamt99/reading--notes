# What is HTML?
*HTML is a computer language that was created to enable for the development of websites. These websites can then be seen by anybody with an Internet connection. It is quite simple to learn, with most people being able to grasp the fundamentals in a single sitting; yet it is rather powerful in terms of what it allows you to produce. Under the guidance of the Â« W3C, the organization tasked with creating and maintaining the language, it is continuously being revised and evolved to suit the expectations and requirements of the increasing Internet audience.*

#### The definition of HTML is HyperText Markup Language.

## **How does it work**?
*The tags in HTML are a collection of short codes entered into a text file by the site author. After that, the text is saved as an html file and read using a browser such as Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. This browser reads the file and converts the content into a viewable format, attempting to present the page as intended by the creator. Writing your own HTML necessitates the proper application of tags in order to realize your idea. To generate HTML pages, you may use anything from a simple text editor to a sophisticated graphical editor.*
#### What are the tags up to?
*Tags are what distinguish plain text from HTML code. You may recognize them as the words that appear between the. They allow all of the interesting things, like graphics and tables, to be rendered on the page simply by telling your browser what to render. The functionality of individual tags will vary. When you visit your page in a browser, the tags themselves don't show up, but their effects do. The simplest tags, such as this one, do little more than apply formatting to some text:
These are the words that will be bold, and these are the words that will not be bold.
The tags were wrapped around some text in the previous example, and when viewed using a standard web browser, the included content will be bolded.*

## Is there anything that HTML can't accomplish?
Of course, as website development has become more popular and demands have grown, new supporting languages have emerged to allow for new developments, and HTML is updated every few years to accommodate advancements.

Cascading Stylesheets are used to modify the appearance of your pages and to make them more accessible. JavaScript adds a lot of power to simple HTML by providing basic special effects and interaction. The majority of this sophisticated technology is reserved for the future, but when all of these technologies are combined, you have a tremendous amount of power at your disposal.
