# CSS Solved a Big Problem:
HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

h1>This is a heading</h1

p>This is a paragraph.</p

When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
